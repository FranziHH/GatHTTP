bezüglich der Möglichkeit spezielle Commandos direkt an den Scanner zu senden habe ich aus Holland folgende Rückmeldung erhalten und das funktioniert auch via RS232.
Yes, you can send host commands to the FM3281. The scanner needs to be connected in USB-CDC to the host. The host can send commands to the scanner via the virtual serial port.
Example to beep : send the below characters (note \x7E means hex value 7E = decimal 126 , \x01 means 01 hex)
\x7E\x010000#BEEPON2000F800T20V;\x03
The syntax of the BEEPON command is :
Lets the device ring once at the frequency and duration received.
Parameter:
F, frequency, unit is Hz, value range is 1 ~ 20000Hz. e.g. 2700F means the frequency of ringing is 2700Hz.
T, Duration, in ms, the range is 1 ~ 10000ms, e.g. 100T means the duration of the sound is 100ms.
V, volume, value range is 1 ~ 20. e.g. 20V means maximum volume.
Transmit: BEEPON$ $ means Data, when Data is '*' or '&', answer: BEEPON<ACK>; when Data is '^', answer: BEEPON1-20000F1-10000T1-20V<ACK>; when Data is xxxFyyyyTnnV (xxx conforms to the range of F parameter, yyyy conforms to the range of T parameter). When Data is xxxFyyyyTnnV (xxx conforms to the range of F parameter, yyyy conforms to the range of T parameter, nn conforms to the range of V parameter), the answer is: <STX> <SOH> 0000#(or @) BEEPON$ <ACK> ($ is the received Data, i.e., xxxFyyyyTnnV); when Data is the rest of the characters, or when Data is empty, the answer is: BEEPON$<NAK>.
Example: send ~<SOH>0000#BEEPON1600F50T20V;<ETX>
Answer <STX><SOH>0000#BEEPON1600F50T20V<ACK>;<ETX>At the same time, send out the loudest sound with the frequency of 1600Hz and duration of 50ms.

For the LED there are only Red and Green led host commands :
\x7E\x010000#LEDONS2C2000D;\x03 --> Set the green LED (2C) for 2000 ms
\x7E\x010000#LEDONS0C4000D;\x03 --> Set the red LED (2C) for 4000 ms
